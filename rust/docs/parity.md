# Source-backed migration ledger

Baseline: Swift tree at `435c4c8a3` (2026-10-04 checkout). `AGENTS.md` and
`NEXT-RELEASE.md` were read; the explicit Rust-branch request supersedes their
Swift next-release branch/native-only instructions. Swift files and release
assets are unchanged.

This is a **vertical slice, not feature parity**. The broad product inventory
below is deliberately unweighted: passing tests do not equal completed features.
A working Responses chat is materially smaller than the source application.

Paths in the source column are relative to the repository root. Core source
paths begin `packages/swift-host/Sources/PiAgentCore/` (abbreviated `Core/` below).
Native UI paths begin `apps/macos/PiApp/` (abbreviated `App/`).

| Capability | Source inspected / implementation reference | Rust state / verification |
|---|---|---|
| Profile validation and endpoint normalization | Core/Profile.swift; Core/Profiles.swift | Implemented subset in profile.rs; HTTPS/loopback, capacities, identity, headers tested. Unknown profile options rejected |

## Storage and privacy

The source session journals and native metadata are plaintext; credentials use
Keychain. New HTTP captures are plaintext-v2, with a legacy encrypted reader.
The Rust slice has its own plaintext storage and no native vault/capture/import
parity. See [the source-backed storage and privacy contract](storage-and-privacy.md)
for isolation, durability, format, permission, recovery, and backup limits.

## Verification record

- Initial exact-source isolated core workspace: 16 unit tests + 5 loopback
  transport tests passed (2026-10-04 02:55 UTC).
- Integrated Rust workspace: 18 unit + 2 actor/lifecycle + 5 loopback transport
  tests passed, and native GPUI application built (2026-10-04 03:12 UTC).
- Strict Clippy (`-D warnings`) and rustfmt checks passed on the first integrated
  slice. The integrator records final pinned-build checks and screenshots.
- Corrected source-based native shell rendered on Linux software Vulkan. Native
  QA passed typing, draft-preserving Close/Keep working, Return-to-Send and a
  real local fixture SSE response. Original Swift pixel comparison and complete
  macOS interaction remain unverified. Dark/minimum-size/reflow review continues.
- Two source-geometry/stale-layout-write tests bring the workspace total to 27
  passing tests as of 2026-10-04 03:35 UTC.
- Snapshot publishing is event-driven; disk commits and commands run off the UI
  thread. The interrupted-worker race and async-runtime-drop regression are covered.
- Final journal core: 34 unit + 2 actor/lifecycle + 5 loopback transport tests
  passed (2026-10-04 04:56 UTC). Independent review cleared interruption-capacity
  admission, held-edit recovery reserve, and uncertain first-journal creation.
- Quick Open presentation/search generation and file-tab save/close lifecycle
  have unit coverage. Latest native Quick Open, dark/minimum-size, wrapping,
  and file-tab interaction validation is blocked by the disconnected desktop.
- No real gateway, paid model call, user credential or source-app storage used in
  automated validation.

## Next implementation priorities

1. Preserve the existing UI before extending it: equivalent-state dark/light,
   minimum-size and responsive split/composer checks; close gaps recorded in the
   independent UI checklist. Continue repeated Send/Stop/Retry, queue-hold and
   reopen interaction checks.
2. Add multiple sessions/projects and durable drafts without coupling display
   invalidation to every session.
3. Port guarded tool execution, MCP, resource/skill loading, compaction and replay
   semantics from their source tests. Do not expose unsupported controls early.
4. Add native credential vault/settings and source-backed migration/import.
5. Close Git/editor/terminal/rich transcript/usage parity and platform behavior.
6. Establish equal-workload Swift/GPUI latency and memory baselines on the same
   hardware, then optimize measured bottlenecks and regressions.
